# Terminal Integration

The `goose term` commands let you talk to goose directly from your shell prompt. Instead of switching to a separate REPL session, you stay in your terminal and call goose when you need it.

```bash
gt "what does this error mean?"
```

Goose responds, you read the answer, and you're back at your prompt. The conversation lives alongside your work, not in a separate window you have to manage.

## Command History Awareness

The real power comes from shell integration. Once set up, goose tracks the commands you run, so when you ask a question, it already knows what you've been doing.

No more copy-pasting error messages or explaining "I ran these commands...". Just work normally, then ask goose for help.

## Setup

Add one line to your shell config:

**zsh** (`~/.zshrc`)
```bash
eval "$(goose term init zsh)"
```

**bash** (`~/.bashrc`)
```bash
eval "$(goose term init bash)"
```

**fish** (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`)
```fish
goose term init fish | source
```

**PowerShell** (`$PROFILE`)
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (goose term init powershell)
```

Then restart your terminal or source the config.

## Usage

Once set up, your terminal gets a session ID. All commands you run are logged to that session.

To talk to goose about what you've been doing:

```bash
gt "why did that fail?"
```

`gt` is just an alias for `goose term run`. It opens goose with your command history already loaded.

## What Gets Logged

Every command you type gets stored with its timestamp and working directory. Goose sees commands you ran since your last message to it.

Commands starting with `goose term` or `gt` are not logged (to avoid noise).

## Performance

- **Shell startup**: adds ~10ms
- **Per command**: ~10ms, runs in background (non-blocking)

You won't notice any delay. The logging happens asynchronously after your command starts executing.

## How It Works

`goose term init` outputs shell code that:
1. Sets a `GOOSE_TERMINAL_ID` environment variable
2. Creates the `gt` alias
3. Installs a preexec hook that calls `goose term log` for each command

The hook runs `goose term log <command> &` in the background, which writes to a local SQLite database. When you run `gt`, goose queries that database for commands since your last message.
